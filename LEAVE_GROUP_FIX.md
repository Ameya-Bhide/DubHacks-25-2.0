# Leave Group Feature Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified
The leave group feature was failing when there were multiple members in a group due to a DynamoDB `list_remove` function error:

```
API Error: ValidationException: Invalid UpdateExpression: Invalid function name; function: list_remove
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was in `/app/api/study-groups/route.ts` in the `leaveGroup` action. The code was trying to use DynamoDB's `list_remove` function with a dynamic index:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
UpdateExpression: 'SET members = list_remove(members, :index), memberCount = memberCount - :one',
ExpressionAttributeValues: {
  ':index': group.members.indexOf(userId), // Dynamic index - doesn't work with list_remove
  ':one': 1
}
```

**Why this failed:**
- DynamoDB's `list_remove` function expects a static index or specific position
- Using `indexOf()` to get a dynamic index doesn't work with `list_remove`
- The function name `list_remove` was being interpreted as invalid

## ✅ Solution Implemented
Replaced the `list_remove` approach with a `SET` operation using a filtered array:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE
// Create a new members list without the user
const updatedMembers = group.members.filter((member: string) => member !== userId)

const updateCommand = new UpdateCommand({
  TableName: TABLE_NAME,
  Key: { id: groupId },
  UpdateExpression: 'SET members = :updatedMembers, memberCount = memberCount - :one',
  ConditionExpression: 'contains(members, :userId)',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':userId': userId,
    ':updatedMembers': updatedMembers, // Pre-filtered array
    ':one': 1
  },
  ReturnValues: 'ALL_NEW'
})
```

## 🔧 How the Fix Works

### **Before (Broken)**
1. Try to use `list_remove(members, :index)` with dynamic index
2. DynamoDB rejects the expression as invalid
3. Leave group operation fails

### **After (Fixed)**
1. Filter the members array in JavaScript to remove the user
2. Use `SET members = :updatedMembers` to replace the entire array
3. Decrement member count by 1
4. Operation succeeds

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Single Member (Already Working)**
- ✅ User leaves group with only 1 member
- ✅ Group gets deleted (as intended)
- ✅ No changes needed

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Members (Now Fixed)**
- ✅ User leaves group with 2+ members
- ✅ User is removed from members array
- ✅ Member count is decremented
- ✅ Group remains active

## 📊 Technical Details

### **DynamoDB Operations Used**
- **Before**: `list_remove` (failed with dynamic index)
- **After**: `SET` with pre-filtered array (works reliably)

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Filtering**: Done in JavaScript before DynamoDB operation
- **Network**: Slightly larger payload (entire members array)
- **Reliability**: Much more reliable than `list_remove` with dynamic index

### **Data Consistency**
- **Condition**: `contains(members, :userId)` ensures user is actually a member
- **Atomic**: Single DynamoDB operation updates both members and count
- **Rollback**: If condition fails, no changes are made

## 🚀 Benefits of the Fix

1. **Reliability**: Works consistently with any number of members
2. **Simplicity**: Uses standard DynamoDB `SET` operation
3. **Consistency**: Matches the dev mode implementation approach
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and debug

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ `app/api/study-groups/route.ts` - Fixed leaveGroup action
- ✅ Dev mode already worked correctly (no changes needed)

## 🎯 Summary

The leave group feature now works correctly for both single-member and multi-member groups:

- ✅ **Single member**: Group gets deleted (existing behavior)
- ✅ **Multiple members**: User is removed, group continues (now fixed)
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper validation and error messages
- ✅ **Data consistency**: Atomic operations ensure data integrity

The fix uses a more reliable approach that's consistent with how the dev mode implementation works, ensuring the feature works the same way in both development and production environments! 🎉
