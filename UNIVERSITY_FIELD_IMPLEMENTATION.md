# University Field Implementation

## ‚úÖ Overview
Successfully added a university field to the signup form with a comprehensive dropdown list of universities, including the University of Washington as requested.

## üéØ Features Added

### 1. **University Dropdown Field**
- Added to the signup form between email and password fields
- Includes University of Washington and other major universities
- Required field with validation
- Clean, consistent styling with existing form elements

### 2. **University Options**
The dropdown includes:
- **University of Washington** (as specifically requested)
- University of California system (Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, etc.)
- Stanford University
- University of Southern California
- California Institute of Technology
- Oregon universities (UO, OSU, PSU)
- British Columbia universities (UBC, SFU, UVic)
- "Other" option for universities not listed

### 3. **Data Storage**
- **AWS Mode**: University stored as `custom:university` attribute in Cognito
- **Dev Mode**: University stored in localStorage as `dev-user-university`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Form Updates**
- Updated `SignUpForm.tsx` with university field
- Added form validation for required university selection
- Enhanced TypeScript types to support both input and select elements

### **Authentication Context Updates**
Updated all authentication contexts to support university parameter:
- `UnifiedAuthContext.tsx` (primary context)
- `AWSAuthContext.tsx` (AWS-specific)
- `SimpleAuthContext.tsx` (development mode)

### **Function Signatures**
Updated signup function signature from:
```typescript
signUp(email: string, password: string, givenName: string, familyName: string)
```
To:
```typescript
signUp(email: string, password: string, givenName: string, familyName: string, university: string)
```

## üìä Data Flow

### **Signup Process**
1. User selects university from dropdown
2. Form validates university is selected
3. University data passed to authentication context
4. **AWS Mode**: Stored as `custom:university` in Cognito user attributes
5. **Dev Mode**: Stored in localStorage for development testing

### **AWS Cognito Integration**
- University stored as custom attribute: `custom:university`
- Requires custom attribute to be configured in AWS Cognito User Pool
- Attribute will be available in user profile after signup

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Cognito Configuration Required

To fully support the university field in production, you need to:

1. **Add Custom Attribute in AWS Console**:
   - Go to AWS Cognito Console
   - Select your User Pool
   - Go to "Sign-up experience" tab
   - Under "Required attributes", add custom attribute:
     - Name: `university`
     - Type: `String`
     - Mutable: `Yes`

2. **Update User Pool Schema**:
   - The custom attribute will be stored as `custom:university`
   - This allows the university data to persist with user accounts

## üß™ Testing

### **Development Mode**
- University data stored in localStorage
- Can be retrieved for testing purposes
- No AWS configuration required

### **AWS Mode**
- University data stored in Cognito user attributes
- Available in user profile after successful signup
- Requires proper AWS Cognito configuration

## üìù Usage

### **For Users**
1. Fill out signup form
2. Select university from dropdown (required)
3. Complete signup process
4. University information is saved with their account

### **For Developers**
- University data available in user attributes
- Can be used for study group filtering by university
- Can be displayed in user profiles
- Can be used for university-specific features

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Configure AWS Cognito** custom attribute for production
2. **Add university filtering** to study group features
3. **Display university** in user profiles
4. **Add university-specific** study group recommendations
5. **Expand university list** based on user feedback

- `components/SignUpForm.tsx` - Added university dropdown field
- `contexts/UnifiedAuthContext.tsx` - Updated signup function
- `contexts/AWSAuthContext.tsx` - Updated AWS signup function
