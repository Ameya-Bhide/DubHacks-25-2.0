# Study Group File Sharing Feature

## ✅ Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive file sharing system that automatically shares uploaded files with all members of a study group. The system uploads files to AWS S3, notifies group members, and provides download functionality.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### **1. File Upload & Storage**
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Files uploaded to S3 with organized folder structure
- **File Metadata**: Stores file information in DynamoDB
- **Unique File Names**: Uses UUID to prevent naming conflicts
- **File Type Support**: Supports common document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, etc.)

### **2. Study Group Notifications**
- **Automatic Notifications**: All study group members get notified of new files
- **Personal Files**: Files marked as "Personal" are not shared
- **Notification System**: Real-time notifications with download links
- **Read/Unread Status**: Track notification status

### **3. File Download System**
- **Secure Downloads**: Files downloaded directly from S3

```typescript
POST /api/upload-file
- Uploads file to AWS S3
- Creates unique file key with study group organization
- Returns file record with metadata
```

#### **2. File Download (`/api/download-file`)**
```typescript
GET /api/download-file?s3Key={fileKey}
- Downloads file from S3
- Returns file with original name

```typescript
POST /api/study-group-files
Actions:
- saveFileRecord: Save file metadata and notify members
- getStudyGroupFiles: Get all files for a study group
- getUserNotifications: Get user's file notifications
- markNotificationRead: Mark notification as read
```
