The Legend of the Suns is a Nahua creation myth that was often invoked in Aztec political and religious discourse. In the context of the novel, the legend serves as a metaphor for Moctezuma's rule and the political turmoil surrounding it. 

The ant in the legend represents Moctezuma - like the ant, he is silent and withdrawn, but ultimately holds the key to understanding the empire's fate. The cihuacoatl, Tlilpotonqui, is obsessed with deciphering the meaning of the ant metaphor, as it relates to Moctezuma's decision-making and his increasingly strained relationship with his longtime political ally.

Moctezuma's reliance on omens, visions, and hallucinogens to guide his rule has alienated many of his advisors and subjects. The cihuacoatl senses that Moctezuma is slipping away from him, and the ant metaphor represents Moctezuma's opaque and inscrutable thought process. Unraveling this metaphor becomes crucial for Tlilpotonqui as he tries to navigate the political crisis engulfing the Aztec empire.

The Legend of the Suns thus serves as a symbolic framework for exploring the breakdown of Moctezuma's rule and the power dynamics between the emperor and his closest political confidant, the cihuacoatl. Understanding this mythological subtext is key to grasping the deeper significance of the political turmoil depicted in the novel.
