Arriving at the University of Washington, I found myself deeply immersed in my studies, leading to a profound reflection on my relationship with my siblings. The realization that not seeing them daily after a 12-year routine contributed to feelings of homesickness and familial love was eye-opening.

Siblings can be more than just family members; they can be significant influences in one's life. Growing up alongside someone creates a bond that cannot be replicated. This dynamic, however, can also lead to sibling politics, where competition for parental attention and influence becomes a constant battle. Name-calling, invasion of personal space, and disputes over music preferences were common occurrences in my household, as my siblings and I vied for dominance.

As I matured, the relationship with my siblings evolved. The initial alienation and division gave way to a newfound appreciation for their presence. The time apart allowed us to develop our own identities and interests, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and supportive dynamic. Now, even the smallest moments spent together are cherished, and the bond we share has become a source of strength and comfort.

Reflecting on the novel "Lost Children Archive," I find myself both envious and grateful for the sibling relationship portrayed. While the characters' journey was marked by a sense of unity and understanding, my own experiences were colored by the challenges of sibling rivalry. Yet, the realization that I have been able to reconnect with my siblings and forge a deeper connection fills me with a sense of gratitude and hope.

As I continue my journey through college, the importance of my siblings has become increasingly clear. They are not just family, but integral parts of my identity, shaping who I am and who I will become. The lessons learned from our tumultuous past have equipped me with a greater appreciation for the power of sibling relationships, both in their joys and their complexities
