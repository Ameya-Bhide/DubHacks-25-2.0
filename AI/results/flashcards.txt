What is the goal of a symmetric/secret-key cryptography scheme?

The sender and receiver share a secret key to communicate securely in the presence of an adversary.

What are the three algorithms that make up a symmetric encryption scheme?

Key generation, encryption, and decryption.

What is the purpose of Kerckhoff's principle in cryptography?

Kerckhoff's principle states that an encryption scheme must be secure even if everything about it, except the key, is public knowledge.

True or false: The one-time pad satisfies perfect secrecy.

True.

What is the informal security requirement for a secure block cipher?

The behavior of a secure block cipher should be "indistinguishable" from that of a randomly chosen substitution table.

What does it mean for a block cipher to be a pseudorandom permutation (PRP)?

It means that the block cipher is computationally indistinguishable from a truly random permutation.

What is the goal of IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack) security?

The goal is to ensure that ciphertexts leak nothing about the plaintexts, other than what was known beforehand.

What is the relationship between pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and pseudorandom permutations (PRPs)?

For block ciphers with large enough block sizes, the notions of PRF and PRP are essentially equivalent.

What is the purpose of randomization in symmetric encryption schemes?

Randomization is used to achieve semantic security, where ciphertexts do not leak any information about the plaintexts.

What is the main advantage of AES-128 over other theoretically sound block ciphers?

AES-128 is a highly practical and efficient block cipher, with native hardware support in many
